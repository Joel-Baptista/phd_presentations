                \item \textbf{Fast Thinking}: Correlation, pattern recognition, subconscious, ...
                \item \textbf{Slow Thinking}: Logical (causal), calculating, conscious, ...

    Many researchers believe that AI can only utilize "fast thinking" (System I). They propose causality to reach "slow thinking" (System II).
