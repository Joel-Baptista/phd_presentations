    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning}: Learning to achieve a goal with interventions.
        \item \textbf{Causal Learning}: Learning how the world works with interventions.
    \end{itemize}

    It looks like both of these learning methodologies revolve around \textbf{interventional data}.

    Additionally, learning a more descriptive representation of the world (through causal learning) can help
    Reinforcement Learning.

    The idea of joining Causality with Reinforcement Learning 
    is called recently began to be explored and is called \textbf{Causal Reinforcement Learning}.
